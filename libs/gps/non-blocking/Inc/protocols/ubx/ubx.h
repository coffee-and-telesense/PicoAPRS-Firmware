 * @brief UBX Protocol Implementation for u-blox GPS Modules
 *
 * @details This module provides a stateless implementation of the UBX protocol
 *          used in u-blox GPS modules. It handles packet formatting, checksum
 *          calculation, and validation while working directly with provided
 *          buffers to minimize memory usage.
 *
 * The UBX protocol uses a binary packet format:
 * +-------+-------+-------+-----+--------+---------+-------+-------+
 * | SYNC1 | SYNC2 | CLASS | ID  | LENGTH | PAYLOAD | CK_A  | CK_B  |
 * | 0xB5  | 0x62  |  1B   | 1B  |   2B   |   NB    |  1B   |  1B   |
 * +-------+-------+-------+-----+--------+---------+-------+-------+
 *
 * Features:
 * - Packet preparation for command and configuration messages
 * - Checksum calculation using Fletcher algorithm
 * - Packet validation including size, structure, and checksum
 * - Special handling for ACK/NACK responses
 * - Helper functions for packet size calculation and frame access
 *
 * @note This implementation follows a stateless design where all state
 *       management is handled by the driver layer. The protocol layer
 *       focuses purely on packet handling.
 *
 * @see u-blox MAX-M10 Interface Manual v5.10 for protocol details
 *      https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/max-m10-series#Documentation-&-resources
