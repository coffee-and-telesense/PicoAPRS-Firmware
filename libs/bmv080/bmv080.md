# Bosch BMV080 Driver

## Overview

This driver is used to initialize and configure a [Bosch BMV080 sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/particulate-matter-sensor/bmv080/), and retrieve particulate matter (PM) air quality data. Communication with the sensor takes place over I2C, using an I2C handle created with the STM32 HAL.

The driver relies on static compiled library files `lib_bmv080.a` and `lib_postProcessor.a` provided by Bosch, as Bosch does not provide documentation for directly interfacing with the sensor. In addition, the static libraries make use of `float` values, so users of this driver should be aware that software floating point operations will take place in the absence of an FPU.

The sensor supports a continuous measurement mode in addition to duty-cycle operation. This mode of operation results in a significantly higher power draw than duty-cycle mode, so example code has not been included. However, the `bmv080_start_continuous_measurement` function is available for experimentation with this mode.

### Driver Structure

As noted above, this driver relies on statically compiled code provided by Bosch, in files `lib_bmv080.a` and `lib_postProcessor.a`, and related header files `bmv080_defs.h` and `bmv080.h`. The Bosch code may be requested from Bosch through their [website SDK request form](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/double-opt-in-forms/sdk-v11-1.html).

The Bosch-provided SDK code includes STM32 example implementations as well as the static libraries. This code was referenced in creation of the callback functions for I2C read and write, as well the the delay callback.

### Example Usage

The following example shows creation and initialization of a `bmv080_sensor_t` struct, which contains a pointer to an I2C handle previously initialized in application code.

**Note:** This example code relies on floating point printing being enabled. If it is not enabled, the sensor may be initialized and run, but floating point output from the Bosch library will not be displayed. The following is an example of this configuration in cmake:
```cmake
target_link_options(test_bmv080 PRIVATE -u _printf_float)
```

```c
#include "bmv080_driver.h"

int main(void) {
  bmv080_sensor_t bmv080;
  bmv080_init(&bmv080, &hi2c1);
  bmv080_configure_duty_cycle(&bmv080, 20); // 20 second cycle
  if (bmv080.status != E_BMV080_OK)
    printf("Failed to configure duty cycle: %d\r\n", bmv080.status);
  bmv080_start_duty_cycle(&bmv080);

  while (1)
  {
    if (bmv080_poll(&bmv080) == E_BMV080_OK && bmv080.data_available)
    {
      // Floating point output
      bmv080_print_output(&bmv080.output);

      // Convert to fixed-point representation
      bmv080_fixed_t fixed = bmv080_to_fixed(&bmv080.output);

      // Print fixed-point values (example)
      debug_print("Fixed output: runtime=%u (0.01s), PM1=%u, PM2.5=%u, PM10=%u, flags=0x%02X\r\n",
                        fixed.runtime_in_0_01_sec,
                        fixed.pm1,
                        fixed.pm2_5,
                        fixed.pm10,
                        fixed.flags);

      bmv080.data_available = false;
      debug_print("\r\n");
    }
    HAL_Delay(100); // Polling period
  }
}

```

## Driver API

### `bmv080_sensor_t` struct

Structure to store necessary configuration and data to interact with the sensor over I2C.

**Fields:**
- `handle`: Internal driver handle, initialized to NULL
- `status`: Latest status code from BMV080 operations
- `i2c_handle`: I2C communication interface
- `output`: Most recent sensor output structure
- `data_available`: Indicates whether new sensor data is available

### `bmv080_fixed_t` struct

Structure to store scaled fixed point output values as `uint16_t` values. This reduced-size format may be helpful for transporting values.

**Fields:**
- `pm1`: PM1 mass concentration in fixed-point format (0–65535 maps to 0–1000 µg/m³)
- `pm2_5`: PM2.5 mass concentration in fixed-point format (0–65535 maps to 0–1000 µg/m³)
- `pm10`: PM10 mass concentration in fixed-point format (0–65535 maps to 0–1000 µg/m³)
- `runtime_in_0_01_sec`: Runtime since measurement start, stored in 0.01-second resolution (max ~655 s)
- `flags`: Bitfield: [0] = obstructed, [1] = outside measurement range

### `bmv080_init()`

Initializes `sensor` as a BMV080 sensor interface by calling `bmv080_open`, which sets the default I2C read and write functions, as well as the delay callback; updates `sensor->status` with result of `bmv080_open` call.

**Parameters:**
- `sensor`: Pointer to newly initialized BMV080 sensor interface
- `i2c_handle`: Pointer to I2C handle

### **`bmv080_get_tick_ms()`**
Get the current system time in milliseconds. Used by the BMV080 driver for timing in duty cycle mode.

**Returns:**
Current tick count in milliseconds

### **`bmv080_configure_duty_cycle()`**
Configure the sensor's duty cycling period.

**Parameters:**
- `sensor`: Pointer to initialized sensor struct

**Returns:**
Status code from BMV080 API

### **`bmv080_start_duty_cycle()`**
Start a BMV080 measurement in duty cycling mode.

**Parameters:**
- `sensor`: Pointer to initialized sensor struct

**Returns:**
Status code from BMV080 API

### **`bmv080_poll()`**

- `header`: Header information for the following payload
- `payload`: Payload to be read consisting of 16 bit words
- `payload_length`: Number of payload elements to be read

**Returns:**
0 if successful, otherwise the return value is an externally defined error code

### **`bmv080_i2c_write()`**
Implements the default I2C write transaction.

**Parameters:**
- `handle`: Handle for the I2C interface
- `header`: Header information for the following payload
- `payload`: Payload to be written consisting of 16 bit words

**Returns:**
Status code (int8_t)

### **`bmv080_is_valid_output()`**
Validates the BMV080 sensor output for numeric correctness. Checks for NaN and out-of-bounds values in the PM2.5 reading. Returns false if any critical value is invalid or the pointer is null. This function can be used to filter corrupt or uninitialized frames before processing or conversion.

**Parameters:**
- `o`: Pointer to the BMV080 sensor output structure to validate

**Returns:**
true if the output is valid, false otherwise

### **`bmv080_to_fixed()`**
Converts BMV080 sensor output to a fixed-point representation. Maps float values from the BMV080 output structure into fixed-point fields suitable for transmission or compact storage. PM values are scaled to 16-bit unsigned integers using a linear transformation from 0–1000 µg/m³ to 0–65535. Runtime is converted to a 0.01-second resolution. Obstruction and range validity flags are encoded in a compact bitfield.

**Parameters:**
- `o`: Pointer to the BMV080 sensor output structure to convert

**Returns:**
bmv080_fixed_t structure containing the fixed-point values

## Constants

### **`BMV080_I2C_ADDRESS`**
Default I2C address for the BMV080 sensor.

**Value:** `0x57`

**Note:** The datasheet states that the default I2C address is 0x57, but the Bosch example code uses 0x54 as the default. User should confirm the address and override as needed.
