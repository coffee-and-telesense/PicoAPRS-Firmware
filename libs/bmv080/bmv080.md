# Bosch BMV080 Driver

## Overview

This driver is used to initialize and configure a [Bosch BMV080 sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/particulate-matter-sensor/bmv080/), and retrieve particulate matter (PM) air quality data. Communication with the sensor takes place over I2C, using an I2C handle created with the STM32 HAL.

The driver relies on static compiled library files `lib_bmv080.a` and `lib_postProcessor.a` provided by Bosch, as Bosch does not provide documentation for directly interfacing with the sensor. In addition, the static libraries make use of `float` values, so users of this driver should be aware that software floating point operations will take place in the absense of an FPU.
